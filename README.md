Advent Calendar Challenge - SQL Practice ðŸŽ„
I am participating in an Advent Calendar challenge that involves solving one SQL task every day.

This is a great opportunity to reinforce my SQL skills and apply the knowledge I've gained from various courses in a practical way.

To deepen my understanding, I prepare additional questions related to the provided database each day, which allows me to explore the data further and practice more advanced queries.

I am using MySQL for this challenge and upload my solutions daily as separate files in this repository.

Feel free to follow along and explore the solutions! ðŸ˜Š
